# softmicro
This software is a simulator for a multi-byte size instruction microprocessor. This is to replace a hardware Z80 by something like a Z80 on steroids.
This processor will be implemented in software running on a modern chip. The instruction set is defined in softmicro.ods. It's not compatible with a Z80. It's a first draft which will be subject to change. The simulator works based on simple checks.
